# Key Encryption GUI

This project provides a GUI for encrypting private keys. Keys are encrypted using a password provided by the user and stored as a key file. This key file is decrypted using the encryption password and used for wallet operations in other tools within the main repository.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from the releases.

### Source Code

1. To install the package, run:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/dfkburnem/Key-Encryption-GUI/releases/download/v1.0.1/key_encryption_gui-1.0.1.tar.gz
```
2. Run script using:

```bash
key_encryption_gui
```

### Executable

Download the executable from the releases page and run it directly:

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/dfkburnem/Key-Encryption-GUI/releases).
2. Download the executable file (Key Encryption GUI.exe).
3. Run the executable.

## Usage

1. **Enter a Password:** Provide a password that will be used for encryption.
2. **Specify Number of Keys:** Enter the number of private keys you want to encrypt.
3. **Select Save Directory:** Choose the directory where the key files will be saved.
4. **Enter Private Keys and Names:** Input your private keys and desired file names.
5. **Create Keys:** Click the "Create Keys" button to generate the encrypted key files.

## Important Note

- **Executable vs Script**: While the executable provides an easier way to run the application, it is not as trustless as running the script directly from the source code. If security and transparency are priorities, consider using the script.
